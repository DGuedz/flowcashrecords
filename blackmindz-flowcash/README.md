## 🏆 Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon 2025 - RWA & DeFi Track

### 💡 The Problem
Musical artists lose **70-85% of revenue** to intermediaries. Traditional music industry structure:
- Multiple middlemen between artist and earnings
- Opaque royalty distribution
- 6-12 month payment delays
- No direct ownership for supporters

### 🎯 Our Solution: Cultural Patronage Protocol
Flow Ca$h democratizes music rights via blockchain, delivering **100% of net royalties** directly to NFT holders through an innovative **Dual-Yield System**.

**Key Innovation:** World's first musical RWA with cross-chain claims via Wormhole messaging protocol.

## 🚀 What Makes Flow Ca$h Unique

### 1️⃣ Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization
- **Phonogram Neighboring Rights** of the track "Correntes"
- Tracked via ISRC code: `BR-XXX-25-00001`
- 100% transparent on-chain distribution
- Legal structure designed for Brazilian regulation compliance

### 2️⃣ Dual-Yield Revenue Model
```
Streams → Royalties (ISRC tracked) → RoyaltyDistributor Contract
↓
Kamino Lend DeFi
↓
Holders earn: Royalties + DeFi Interest
```

**Example:**
- Music generates $100 in royalties/month
- Invested in Kamino Lend at 7.2% APY
- Holders receive: $100 + $6 interest = **106% return**

### 3️⃣ Cross-Chain Infrastructure (Wormhole)
- Bridge $CHAINS tokens: Solana ⟷ EVM networks
- Bridge NFTs: Polygon, Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum
- **Cross-Chain Claims:** Own NFT on Polygon, claim USDC rewards from Solana
- Universal liquidity across ecosystems

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18.2** + Tailwind CSS - Modern, responsive UI
- **React Router 6** - SPA navigation
- **@solana/wallet-adapter** - Wallet integration
- **@devfunlabs/web-sdk** - DevBase infrastructure

### Smart Contracts (Rust/Anchor)
```
programs/
├── royalty-distributor/    # Core royalty management
│   ├── deposit_royalties() # Receive royalties from DSPs
│   ├── process_claim()     # User claims rewards
│   └── invest_in_defi()    # Auto-invest in Kamino
├── token-factory/          # RWA token creation
└── vault-manager/          # DeFi vault operations
```

### Integrations
- **Kamino Finance** - DeFi yield optimization
- **Wormhole** - Cross-chain messaging & bridging
- **Metaplex** - NFT standard for "Correntes" collection
- **Pump.fun** - Bonding curve for $CHAINS token
